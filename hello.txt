If an IP packet arrives at a router and the TTL is 1 (and the destination IP is not the router itself) which of the following will occur?

Question 1 options:

The router will look in its routing table and determine the number of hops remaining and then it will increment the TTL and forward the packet.


The router will drop the packet and send nothing


The router will drop the packet and send an ICMP “Timed Exceed In Transit” message to the previous router


The router will drop the packet and send an ICMP “Timed Exceed In Transit” message to the source IP of the packet
